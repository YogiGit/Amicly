# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Sentry for React Native error tracking, custom teen safety event monitoring with privacy-compliant data collection
- **Backend Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch + X-Ray for Lambda function performance, custom safety incident alerting and escalation monitoring
- **Error Tracking:** Centralized error aggregation with teen privacy protection, automated safety incident detection and human moderator alerts
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time conversation response time tracking, voice processing latency monitoring, crisis response time measurement

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Core Web Vitals for parent dashboard performance
- JavaScript errors with teen privacy protection (no conversation content in logs)
- API response times for conversation flow optimization
- User interactions and engagement patterns (anonymized for teen privacy)

**Backend Metrics:**
- Request rate and conversation volume patterns
- Error rate with safety incident correlation
- Response time for AI conversation processing (<3 second target)
- Database query performance for conversation history and family data access

**Safety-Specific Metrics:**
- Crisis detection accuracy and false positive rates
- Safety incident response times and resolution outcomes
- Content moderation effectiveness and human review workload
- Family notification delivery success rates during emergencies

**Teen Privacy Metrics:**
- Age-graduated privacy control adoption rates
- Parent dashboard engagement without conversation content access
- Privacy setting changes and family communication patterns
