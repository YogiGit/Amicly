# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The interface should feel like texting with your most trusted friend - familiar, non-judgmental, and effortlessly natural. Visual design emphasizes warmth and safety over flashy gaming aesthetics, reassuring parents while appealing to teens through authentic conversation flows. The UI prioritizes conversational interaction over complex navigation, with AI personality expressed through thoughtful response timing, gentle animations, and contextual emoji usage that feels genuinely supportive rather than artificially cheerful.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Conversation-First Design:** Primary interaction is natural chat interface with voice recording via hold-to-talk button. Settings and features are accessed through conversational commands ("Hey, can you forget what we talked about yesterday?") rather than complex menus.

**Progressive Privacy Disclosure:** Teen users gradually discover and control privacy features through contextual prompts rather than overwhelming initial setup. Parent dashboard integration feels optional and teen-controlled rather than surveillance-focused.

**Emotional State Awareness:** Visual interface subtly adapts to conversation tone - warmer colors during supportive moments, calmer palettes during stress discussions, never dramatic but gently responsive to emotional context.

## Core Screens and Views

- **Main Conversation Screen** - Full-screen chat interface with voice/text toggle, emotional state indicators, and contextual coaching prompts
- **Privacy Control Center** - Simple toggle interface for parent sharing permissions, memory retention settings, and conversation topics
- **Parent Dashboard (Web)** - High-level progress insights, safety notifications, and anonymous usage patterns without conversation details
- **Onboarding Flow** - Interactive tutorial establishing AI personality, privacy boundaries, and family communication preferences
- **Settings & Safety** - Crisis resources, account management, and AI behavior customization options

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full WCAG AA compliance including screen reader optimization, high contrast modes, voice navigation support, and text sizing options. Particularly important for inclusivity given diverse teen needs and potential learning differences in target demographic.

## Branding

**Warm Minimalism with Authentic Personality:** Clean, uncluttered design using soft, welcoming colors (warm blues, gentle greens, calming purples) that feel mature enough for teens but reassuring for parents. Typography emphasizes readability and friendliness. Avoid cartoon aesthetics or gaming-style visual effects that could appear childish or purely entertainment-focused. Brand personality is "wise friend" rather than "fun game" or "clinical tool."

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

**Phase 1:** Android-optimized responsive design (5.0+ API level 21) with performance optimized for older devices
**Phase 2:** iOS version with design system consistency and feature parity
**Parent Dashboard:** Web responsive (desktop and mobile browsers) for accessibility across family devices
