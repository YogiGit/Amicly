# Epic 2: Privacy Controls & Family Integration (REVISED)

**Epic Goal:** Implement age-graduated privacy controls that evolve with teen development, family account linking with developmentally appropriate oversight levels, and transparent progression from higher parent involvement to teen autonomy.

## Story 2.1: Age-Graduated Privacy Framework

As a **teenager**,
I want **privacy controls that match my developmental stage and grow with me**,
so that **I have appropriate autonomy while maintaining family safety and trust**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Age 13-14:** Default moderate parent access with teen override options for sensitive topics
2. **Age 15-16:** Default balanced access with teen controlling most sharing decisions
3. **Age 17-18:** Default high privacy with teen controlling nearly all sharing, crisis-only exceptions
4. **Privacy graduation prompts:** "You're 15 now - want to update your privacy settings?"
5. **Reverse graduation option:** Teens can choose to maintain or increase parent access at any age
6. **Clear explanation of age-appropriate privacy reasoning and developmental psychology

## Story 2.2: Dynamic Privacy Evolution

As a **teenager**,
I want **the ability to adjust my privacy level as I mature and my relationship with my parents evolves**,
so that **the app supports healthy family development rather than creating conflict**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Privacy level assessment:** Periodic check-ins about desired parent involvement level
2. **Graduated transition periods:** 30-day grace periods when changing from more to less parent access
3. **Family discussion prompts:** App suggests conversations when teens want major privacy changes
4. **Achievement-based privacy:** Option to earn more privacy through consistent positive app usage
5. **Crisis override clarity:** Explicit explanation of when safety concerns override privacy settings
6. **Parent notification of privacy changes:** Parents informed of changes with teen-approved reasoning

## Story 2.3: Developmentally-Appropriate Parent Dashboard

As a **parent**,
I want **oversight appropriate to my teenager's developmental stage**,
so that **I can provide suitable support while respecting their growing autonomy**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **13-14 Dashboard:** More detailed progress insights, conversation topic summaries, mood patterns
2. **15-16 Dashboard:** General wellness trends, achievement notifications, academic progress indicators
3. **17-18 Dashboard:** Crisis alerts only, basic usage stats, achievement celebrations
4. **Educational content:** Developmental psychology resources explaining why privacy increases with age
5. **Transition support:** Guidance for parents adapting to reduced visibility as teens mature
6. **Family goal coordination:** Age-appropriate collaborative features (more directive for younger, consultative for older)

## Story 2.4: Trust-Building Transparency Engine

As a **family**,
I want **clear understanding of how privacy levels work and why they change**,
so that **privacy evolution strengthens rather than strains family relationships**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Privacy explanation system:** Clear rationale for age-based defaults with developmental science backing
2. **Family transparency dashboard:** Both teen and parent see what the other can access
3. **Change notification system:** All privacy modifications communicated to both parties with reasoning
4. **Conflict resolution resources:** Guidance when teens and parents disagree about appropriate privacy levels
5. **Success story examples:** Case studies showing how graduated privacy supports healthy family development
6. **Professional resources:** Access to family counselors or teen development experts for privacy disputes

## Story 2.5: Crisis Override and Safety Escalation

As a **safety system**,
I want **clear protocols for when safety concerns override privacy settings**,
so that **teen safety is protected while maintaining trust in the privacy framework**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Crisis detection thresholds:** Clear criteria for when safety overrides privacy (self-harm, abuse, immediate danger)
2. **Escalation transparency:** Teens and parents understand exactly when and why privacy is breached for safety
3. **Professional intervention protocols:** Direct connection to crisis counselors, not just parent notification
4. **Post-crisis privacy restoration:** Clear process for returning to normal privacy levels after crisis resolution
5. **False positive management:** System for addressing when crisis detection triggers unnecessarily
6. **Legal compliance documentation:** Audit trail for safety decisions meeting regulatory requirements
